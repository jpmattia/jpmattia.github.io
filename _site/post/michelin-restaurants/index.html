        <p>The earlier restaurant stories serve as mere appetizers to an actual discussion of restaurants. Rather than describe the
spiraling path to how one begins spending inordinate amounts for great meals, or the self-rationalization and
self-justification for an obviously irrational habit, let’s skip to the end of the story and discuss two of greatest
restaurants I’ve ever had the pleasure of [attending. eating at]</p>

<p>Once you determine you’re part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: The Michelin star.</p>

<p>Michelin has in interesting history with restaurants. Most folks have heard of the Michelin Tire Company, which is one
of the oldest tire corporations and is based in France. Early on in automobile history, many companies had marketing to
encourage automobile travel. Here in the US, there were guides to traveling around to scenic western destinations.
Michelin took the approach of having travel guides with reviews of hotels and restaurants. The more mileage you put on
the tires, the more tires they sell, which made it a brilliant piece of marketing.</p>

<p>At some point, the marketing took on a life of its own. Some of those restaurant reviews included “Michelin Stars”, and
the graphical star is shown here. Frankly, when you consider gluttony is still one of the seven deadly sins, a pentagram
would have perhaps been more apt, but for reasons known only to a tire company, a 6-rounded point star is their mark of
approval. In any case, unlike modern internet ratings, not all restaurants are given a star rating; only those who
consistently deliver an outstanding meal are awarded even a single star. The largest number ever awarded are three
stars, and if you are a foodie those places are worthy of a special trip.</p>

<p>How did I stumble upon such a restaurant? As a college senior, I took a trip to Europe during MIT January term. My travel
companion had a colorful uncle who we met in Geneva. The uncle, who we will name Henry for this story, had finished grad
school around the late 60s, went off to Europe for a post-graduation trip, and just stayed. He spent a lot of time studying 
good food and wine and, well, life, and was a pleasure to be around.
Playing host to a couple of 
college students, he decided to take our eductation into his own hands and shepharded us to a one-star restaurant.</p>

<p>I did not know what a one-star restaurant was when I walked in, but it turned out to be the nicest meal I had ever
eaten. I was, frankly, stunned; it was a revelation that people could turn food into an art form.</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, I had many questions, but I asked Henry the one foremost in my mind: If that was one star, 
just what goes on at a three star meal? Henry smiled, and then he delivered a critique of the best meal of my life 
up to that point. There was some criticism and second guessing of flavor, but there were a number of points like this
or that course (there were many courses) was a little low for it’s presentation temperature. You could say it was 
because we talked too much, or you could say it was because the plates were not sufficiently warm for a January meal.</p>

<p>He also waxed poetic on the proper amount of attention from the restaurant staff.</p>

<p>in france 400 one stars, about 60 two stars, about 20 three stars. Get current numbers.</p>

<p>Then he told a story about a three-star meal he had: He was trying to impress a</p>

<p>My first visit to a starred restaurant was</p>

<p>All of this was new to me when I had my first trip to Europe:</p>

<p>. I’m sure some of you have worked with creative types, and some of those folks always
have to be different, and so they went with a</p>

<p>During my first trip to Europe, an uncle of a friend decided that
it was time to introduce us to a Michelin-starred restaurant.</p>

<p>I naturally fell into a school-of-thought where some
, and
circumstances</p>

<p>After seeing the prior restaurant stories here, here, and here, it’s probably no surprise that I be</p>

<p>maybe one essay on Michelin starred restaurants:
 what is a Michelin-starred restaurant
 eating at a one-star, what is a three star?
 Kevin and getting into French Laundry</p>

<p>choosing somebody external to managge our computers turned out to be one of the best gastronomical decision of my life.</p>

<p>Ding Dong/Ring Ding  “or as we prefer to call it”
 There are two ways: One is pomposity. Some people like that, but it’s never been my style. The other is a celebration of
 food and eating, and I find that much more gratifying.</p>
