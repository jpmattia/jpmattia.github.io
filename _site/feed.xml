Rather than describe
the spiraling path to how one begins spending inordinate amounts for great meals, or the self-rationalization and
self-justification for an obviously irrational habit, let’s skip to the end of the story and discuss two of greatest
restaurants I’ve ever had the pleasure of [attending.]</p>

<p>Once you determine you’re part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: During my first trip to Europe, the uncle of the person I was
with decided that it was time to introduce us to a Michelin-starred restaurant.</p>

<p>Michelin has in interesting history with restaurants. Most folks have heard of the Michelin Tire Company, which is one
of the oldest tire corporations and is based in France. Early on in automobile history, many companies had marketing to
encourage automobile travel. Here in the US, there were guides to traveling around to scenic western destinations.
Michelin took the approach of having travel guides with reviews of hotels and restaurants. The more mileage you put on
the tires, the more tires they sell, which made it a brilliant piece of marketing.</p>

<p>The marketing took on a life of its own, however. Some of those restaurant reviews included “Michelin Stars”, and the
graphical star is shown here. Frankly, when you consider gluttony is still one of the seven deadly sins, a pentagram
would have perhaps been more apt. I’m sure some of you have worked with graphical designers, and some of those folks
always have to be different, and so they went with a 6-rounded point star.</p>

<p>I realized early on that other people have sifted through the millions of
restaurants in the world. I was</p>

<p>I naturally fell into a school-of-thought where some
, and
circumstances</p>

<p>After seeing the prior restaurant stories here, here, and here, it’s probably no surprise that I be</p>

<p>maybe one essay on Michelin starred restaurants:
 what is a Michelin-starred restaurant
 eating at a one-star, what is a three star?
 Kevin and getting into French Laundry</p>

<p>choosing somebody external to managge our computers turned out to be one of the best gastronomical decision of my life.</p>

<p>Ding Dong/Ring Ding  “or as we prefer to call it”
 There are two ways: One is pomposity. Some people like that, but it’s never been my style. The other is a celebration of
 food and eating, and I find that much more gratifying.</p>

<p>Gained and lost michelin star.

Chinese Beverage Torture, which always brings to mind another story from my teenage years: The first time I ever ate
Chinese food. My family’s food heritage comes with a large serving of pasta, and it took many years before I realized
that our Italian food heritage was probably stolen from China, most likely when Marco Polo came back from Asia and had a
terrible hankering for Peking Ravs.</p>

<p>Growing up, I was not the adventurous foodie you all know and love, and there was a pretty small set of things I would
eat. This state of affairs began in early childhood and continued through puberty, right up until I started dating
someone, who for the purpose of this story we will designate as The First Girlfriend, in order to protect the innocent.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2023/wonton soup with a white chinese spoon200x200.png" alt="image-left" class="align-left" />
When The First Girlfriend suggested that we go out with two other couples to a Chinese restaurant, that sounded like a
smashing idea, partly because it would ease the pressure of this whole dating thing and having to act as an entertaining
person. The only problem was that I had never had Chinese food. As a normal guy with the usual bucket of insecurities
that comes with being 16 years old, there was an acute social pressure to project being a Man of the World™, and there
was no way I could refuse the outing. At the heart of the matter however, I was mostly worried that I didn’t yet know
how to use chopsticks.</p>

<p>We all converged at the restaurant, and the six of us were seated at a round table with a lazy Susan to serve the food
family style.  We ordered wonton soup for an appetizer, and I was relieved because this would delay any use of
chopsticks. The soup arrived, and it was the first time I had encountered the oversized Chinese soup spoons, but this
was easy! The spoons were large! Everything was going swimmingly until it came time to eat the wonton.</p>

<p>The wonton seemed big, so naturally I decided to cut it in half. The spoon had an edge, but the treachery about to
unfold was that the edge of the spoon was rounded and smooth. Unfortunately, the bottom of the bowl was also rounded and
smooth.  Friends, do you know what happens when you try to cut an oversized wonton by forcefully pinching it between a
rounded and smooth spoon, and a rounded and smooth bowl?</p>

<p>The wonton shot out of the bowl and became an airborne projectile. It passed well above the lazy Susan, and over the
heads of our friends on the other side of the table. The rocket fuel that powers those damn things finally exhausted,
and it landed somewhere in the center of the restaurant.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, much laughter ensued. Our table was laughing. The other tables were laughing. The waiter pouring my
water at the time was laughing so hard he had to stop pouring the water.  But hilariously, <em>I</em> was
laughing. Predictably, I remember little else about the meal. I don’t think using chopsticks and my Man of the World™
projection played any role in the evening at all. In spite of such an incredible faux pas, The First Girlfriend and I
continued dating for some time after that, from which I conclude that the speed and distance at which I can catapult a
wonton demonstrates great strength and prowess, and is a terrific way to impress women.</p>

Mary Chung’s. The proprietor, Mary, helped to introduce Chinese food to many MIT students across several
generations. For those students who did not have a wide selection of cuisine before going to college, Mary’s was a
gateway drug to the wide world of food and gastronomy. Students would go there to celebrate achievements, or to drown
their sorrows, or most often just for tasty nourishment. As one of those students, I can tell you that Mary’s fortified
many of us sufficiently to face the rigors of MIT, or maybe it’s more truthful to say that she fattened us up
sufficiently to face the rigors of MIT. Most likely, it’s both.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2023/stainless steel teapot and empty water glasses200x200.png" alt="image-left" class="align-left" />
Sadly at the end of 2022, it came time for Mary to embark on a well-earned retirement and so she closed the
restaurant. Several of her fans started sharing tales about the restaurant across social media: The gatherings of
friends, the best dishes, and stories of their first visits. It reminded me of my own first visit, which I still
remember decades later.</p>

<p>In 1984, I was a sophomore with an undergraduate research project (UROP) in the MIT AI lab. The project I was working on
was a robot named TARDIS, which was an acronym for Tea And Ravioli Delivery Service. At some meeting, I said “that’s a
funny name”, revealing my lack of knowledge about both Dr Who and Mary Chung’s. Some kind grad student took pity on me
and dragged me to Mary’s to cure some of my ignorance.</p>

<p>When you sat down at the restaurant back then, the table was set with tea cups and a pitcher of water. The missing
teapot and missing water glasses would arrive at first service, but until then you were left no possibility of quenching
your thirst, because nobody would dare pour water into the tea cups unless you had the manners of someone raised by
wolves.</p>

<p>The grad student told me this part of the meal was called The Chinese Beverage Torture.</p>

<p>Naturally, since I was a sophomore with a sophomoric sense of humor, I proceeded to tell everyone I knew about this
Chinese restaurant which was great as long as you could endure The Chinese Beverage Torture. One person I told was a
high-school friend down the road at Harvard, who then proceeded speak at length about The Chinese Beverage Torture to
anyone in his dorm who would listen. The dead horse was beaten so often and so prolifically his dormmates told me they
had dubbed it The Chinese-Beverage-Torture Joke Torture.</p>

<p>So join me and raise your teacups and water glasses to Mary and her legacy of spreading joy and happiness and full
stomachs to the good people around Cambridge. I will remember Mary’s always for the Suan la Chow Show, the Peking Ravs,
the Dun Dun Noodles and especially for the Beverage Torture, the last of which was the start of many great
conversations.</p>
