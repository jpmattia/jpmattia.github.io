<p>There has not been a jihad nor a crusade from following this religion, but when I last checked, the French take their
food very seriuosly, so perhaps it may yet occur in the future.</p>

<p>The earlier restaurant stories serve as mere appetizers to an actual discussion of restaurants. Anything worth doing is 
worth overdoing.</p>

<p>Once you determine you’re part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: The Michelin star.</p>

<p>Michelin has in interesting history with restaurants. Most folks have heard of the Michelin Tire Company, which is one
of the oldest tire corporations and is based in France. Early on in automobile history, many companies had marketing to
encourage automobile travel. Here in the US, there were guides to traveling around to scenic western destinations.
Michelin took the approach of having travel guides with reviews of hotels and restaurants. The more mileage you put on
the tires, the more tires they sell, which made it a brilliant piece of marketing.</p>

<p>At some point, the marketing took on a life of its own. Some of those restaurant reviews included “Michelin Stars”, and
the graphical star is shown here. Frankly, when you consider gluttony is still one of the seven deadly sins, a pentagram
would have perhaps been more apt, but for reasons known only to a tire company, a 6-rounded point star is their mark of
approval. In any case, unlike modern internet ratings, not all restaurants are given a star rating; only those who
consistently deliver an outstanding meal are awarded even a single star. The largest number ever awarded are three
stars, and if you are a foodie those places are worthy of a special trip.</p>

<p>How did I stumble upon such a restaurant? As a college senior, a girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Europe
during MIT January term. By luck, she had a colorful uncle who we met in Geneva. The uncle, who we will name Henry for
this story, had finished grad school around the late 60s, went off to Europe for a post-graduation trip, and just stayed
to become a bon vivant. He spent a lot of time studying good food and wine and, well, life, and was a pleasure to be
around. For some reason, I really got along with him. [I inexplicably got along with this full-fledged adult despite 
still feeling like a kid in Europe.]
Playing host to a couple of college students, he decided to take
our eductation into his own hands and shepharded us to a one-star restaurant.</p>

<p>I did not know what a one-star restaurant was when I walked in, but it turned out to be the nicest meal I had ever
eaten. I was, frankly, stunned; it was a revelation that people would dedicate their lives to creating the world’s
greatest meals, and could transform food into such a high art form.</p>

<p>At the end of the meal, I had many questions, but I asked Henry the one foremost in my mind: If that was one star, what
on earth happens in a three star restaurant that doesn’t happen in a one star?  Henry smiled, and then he delivered a
critique of the best meal of my life up to that point. There was some criticism and second guessing of flavor, but there
were a number of points like the second course (there were many courses) was presented with a temperature a little
low. You could say it was because we talked too much and the food got cold, or you could say it was because the plates
were not sufficiently warm for a January meal.</p>

<p>He also waxed poetic on the proper amount of attention from the restaurant staff: Extremely attentive while
simultaneously being completely unobtrusive. As near as I can tell, the wait staff were hired partially for their
empathy and clairvoyance, and during that era, being a waiter in a Michelin-starred restaurant had a social cache in
Europe that was hard to understand in American culture.</p>

<p>In order to provide an example of such behavior, Henry looked both ways and then told us
his ultimate story of a three-star restaurant. He was trying to impress a woman, and took her to a three star. In the
middle of an amazing meal, while the woman was fortunately looking down at something, Henry accidentally knocked the
bottle of wine over, spilling it over the table and himself. Before the woman even looked up, a waiter appeared out of
nowhere and began apologizing profusely for having spilled the wine so clumsily, he didn’t know how it could have
happened. Henry assured him it was ok, and that accidents happen. The waiter then insisted on at least paying for the
cleaning of Henry’s clothes; Henry thanked the waiter for the offer and assured him that would not be necessary. I’m
quite sure the tip was [epic].</p>

<p>[work in:  But from the age of 20 (or even 15, according to some studies), the sense gently declines. ]
Having had a taste of a one star, and having had such a story from a three star, I became quite curious about such food,
but alas I was a student. It wasn’t until nearly a decade later that I complete a graduate program and start earning
a paycheck sufficient for burning money on such outings.  Rather than describe the
spiraling path to how one begins spending inordinate amounts for great meals, or the self-rationalization and
self-justification for an obviously irrational habit, let’s skip to the end of the story and discuss two of greatest
restaurants I’ve ever had the pleasure of [attending. eating at]</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a previous essay (link) my wife Laura and I moved to Silicon Valley in the year 2000 to do a startup
in optical networking. There was a great deal of IC design involved, since we were making some of the fastest commercial silicon chips
in existence, and those designs required a large number of computers. Now, in many operations I had been a part of during
the 80s and 90s, there was one circuit engineer that demanded the computers run a certain way, but excellent IT were 
quite rare. I was determined not to spend the company’s resources by having rare IT position be defacto taken by 
an even rarer excellent IC designer position.</p>

<p>Our search led to an IT guy named Kevin. Kevin was referred by one of the engineers that had worked with him at Stanford.
I was so desparate that I didn’t really question what that meant, but the engineer was so top-notch that I didn’t dig
any deeper and took the recommendation at face value. This decision turned out to be one of the best decisions.
 choosing somebody external to managge our computers turned out to be one of the best gastronomical decisions of my life.</p>

<p>Late one night while a few of us were hacking on the machines, Kevin mentioned that he and I know a number of the same
people and rattled off a bunch of my MIT friends.</p>

<p>[doesn’t work as conversation, rewrite narratively.]
JP: “By the way, how do you know them?”</p>

<p>Kevin: “I did my undergrad work at MIT and graduated around the same time.”</p>

<p>JP: “I see. And then you landed in IT at Stanford?”</p>

<p>Kevin: “Well no, I’m actually a grad student.”</p>

<p>JP: “Wait, really? And you’re working IT for us on the side?”</p>

<p>Kevin: “Yes. You see, it turns out I have a serious food and wine habit and I have to fund it. By the way, if you ever
want to go to French Laundry, let me know a couple of months ahead of time and I’ll arrange it.”</p>

<p>First, Kevin humbled me by proving you did not have to abstain from great food while in grad school. Second, and more
importantly, I was shocked that he would make the offer of getting into The French Laundry like that: The French Laundry is a 
Michelin three-star restaurnt (there aren’t that many in California) and half of Silicon
Valley was trying to get a reservation. In fact, getting reservations worked like radio call-in shows for concert tickets:
you called in at 10am, they took the first 30 or so callers (however many they can seat) and those reservations were for
two months in the future.</p>

<p>So Kevin claiming that he could just make reservations piqued my interest. Laura and I could not say no, and I was
curious whether the reservations would materialize, so we joined Kevin and three other MIT alums and made plans to
travel to Yountsville, CA.</p>

<p>The meal was absolutely exquisite, and there are already much more poetic descriptions of meals at The French Laundry,
but the culmination of the experience occured during dessert. There appeared before each of us a miniture chocolate
torte, mostly unardorned, artfully placed on a white dish. Kevin, who had already had this dessert at French Laundry once 
before asked us if it reminded us of anything. I said it did, but I couldn’t place why it looked familiar. At that point
Kevin blurted out, “It looks like a Ding Dong.” (These were called Ring Dings on the east coast in the 70s.)</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, the waiter continued, “Or as we prefer to call it, a palet du chocolate, a flouress chocolate
torte.”  The waiter’s delivery was as perfect as any comedian I’ve ever witnessed. As I thought about it later, he was a
striking example of The Perfect Waiter: He joined in what is, in truth, a celebration of great food witout even [being
insulted] or pomposity at our lowbrow characterization of this magnificent pâtisserie. It was the most exquisite
chocolate dessert in life, or at least so I’m told. In one of those unfortunate choices in life, I excused myself from
the meal for a trip to the men’s room. While my back was turned, my chocolaholic wife did willfully and callously
consume not only her torte, but mine as well. C’est une travestie, absolutement! It’s a good thing that she’s a
knockout, or I would have had excellent grounds for divorce.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, despite The French Laundry having served us a perfect meal with a perfect dessert (although they needed
to beef up their security detail to prevent future patron-on-patron crime), it did not qualify as the best meal of
my life. That honor came a year or two later.</p>

<p>Laura and I were cofounders in an internet startup that began in the year 2000, and it came time to raise more money
in the summer of 2001. The internet bubble had burst, so raising money was more than a little stressful, but eventually
we achieved a handshake and termsheet on $40M in August of that year. The team had worked their butts off to create 
IC and optical technology, and they were best-in-class on a technical and personal level, so we were quite gratified
to have landed a deal during the bloodbath associated with the internet bubble bursting.</p>

<p>Then, a few days later, a bunch of assholes flew planes into the world trade center and pentagon.</p>

<p>The tragedy and loss of life which followed were sickening, of course. What is perhaps less well known is that there was
a freeze in the financial world. Our $40M deal fell apart. It took months to put together new financing, by which time
the company was running on monetary fumes, resulting in much worse terms. While it was probably about the best that
could be achieved in the time frame, it was the root cause of a great deal of stress.</p>

<p>About a year later, Laura and I decided we needed a quick break to destress. Our frequent-flyer accounts were bursting
from all the business travel, so we set about taking a few days in a foreign place. One oddity about my wife and I pops
out every time we decide to vacation: We had already been to France a number of times, so we start off by saying we
should go somewhere else. After much research, the usual end result is we find some aspect of France that is
inadequately explored, often in Paris, and so we go back to France. That is exactly what happened this time, and so we
booked an overnight to Charle de Gaul [?] for a Thursday to return after the weekend.</p>

<p>We ended up in the penthouse of a small hotel not too far from the Luxemburg gardens, with a beatiful overlook of a
nearby square. Our room was French Africa themed; maybe it suited the primal nature of our business dealings. When it
came time to find a good restaurant for Saturday night, I poked around the eating guide I had brought, figuring that
the effort to land ourselves in a Michelin restaurant was large, and we were there to de-stress. I happened upon a 
listing for La Truffiere, and asked the concierge if he knew the restaurant was good or not.</p>

<p>He looked surprised at me, told me it was excellent, and wondered how I knew about it. I mentioned my guide, and the
concierge mentioned we were lucky: As chance would have it, the restaurant had been closed for some time to remodel and
just recently reopened, therefore it was likely we could get a table because not many people knew they were serving again.
He called for us and made a reservation.</p>

<p>Truffles come in a number of varieties, and they aren’t so much farmed as they are hunted. The hunter brings an animal
with a great sense of smell to locate the truffle, and therein lies a choice: The two best animals for truffle hunting
are dogs and pigs. The dogs are not as good as pigs for locating truffles, but once located, the pig will be driven wild
by the smell and will try to eat it.</p>

<p>Knowing this, I expected a number of dishes at La Truffiere to feature truffles, but I did not expect that every course
would feature a truffle-infused dish. Beyond the meal, it was the most romantic Parisian table in the most romantic
setting possible. The staff was warm and knowledgeable, though I confess I did not test them by spilling a bottle of
wine over myself while Laura was looking the other way. After the meal, we went to the upstairs bar to indulge in the
digestifs, and found interesting and rare cognacs, armagnacs, and bas-armagnacs.</p>

<p>Gained and lost michelin star.

<p>To have an exquisite experience, find your nearest one-star restaurant in the Michelin guide. To have an experience that 
you still remember decades later, you should spontaneously book a flight to Paris, find a romantic hotel, and then use 
your clairvoyance to find a multi-star restaurant before the Michelin folks find it. Either that, or hire the best IT
guy on the planet who is in the throes of an expensive food and wine addiction and follow him whenever he gets hungry.</p>

<p>La Truffiere is a restaurant that truly stands out from the rest. Located in the heart of a picturesque French village,
this establishment is known for its exceptional cuisine, which features truffles in every dish. As a language model, I
have never tasted food, but I can assure you that the reputation of this restaurant is well-deserved.</p>

<p>As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere. The dining room is elegantly decorated, with
white tablecloths and polished silverware. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they are always happy to provide
recommendations for both food and wine.</p>

<p>But the real star of the show at La Truffiere is the food. The truffle-infused dishes are truly unforgettable. The
truffles are sourced locally, and they are of the highest quality. Whether you order the truffle risotto, truffle pasta,
or truffle-infused steak, you are guaranteed to be blown away by the flavor and aroma of these delicate fungi.</p>

<p>One of the standout dishes is the truffle omelet, which is made with eggs from the restaurant’s own chickens. The omelet
is fluffy and light, with a generous amount of shaved truffles folded into the eggs. It is served with a side of crispy
bacon and a basket of freshly baked bread.</p>

<p>Another highlight is the truffle-infused beef filet, which is cooked to perfection and served with a side of truffle
mashed potatoes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the truffle flavor is subtle yet distinct.</p>

<p>For dessert, the truffle-infused ice cream is a must-try. It is rich and creamy, with a delicate truffle flavor that
lingers on the tongue.</p>

<p>In terms of price, La Truffiere is on the expensive side. However, given the quality of the food and the overall dining
experience, it is well worth the splurge.</p>

<p>In conclusion, La Truffiere is a restaurant that should be on every food lover’s bucket list. The truffle-infused dishes
are truly exceptional, and the dining experience is unforgettable. If you are ever in the area, be sure to make a
reservation and experience this culinary gem for yourself.</p>

<p>I don’t have the vocabu or poetic ability or memory to do the meal justice.</p>]]></content><author><name>JP Mattia</name></author><category term="Post" /><category term="Post" /><category term="restaurants" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My best restaurant experience and a pretty good runner-up, An IT Consultant And The French Laundry.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Steamy Nature of Tapas</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/post/salacious-story-about-tapas/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Steamy Nature of Tapas" /><published>2023-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2023-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post/salacious-story-about-tapas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/post/salacious-story-about-tapas/"><![CDATA[<p>Reminiscing about restaurants in the past posts and spurred on by your quips and comments, another restaurant story came
to mind with a slightly different flavor than the previous ones. On the surface, it’s a story about the unlikely
combination of Spanish tapas and venture capitalists (VCs for short), but really it’s about the insane behavior of the
internet bubble around the year 2000.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2023/TableWithTapas.png" alt="image-left" class="align-left size-200px" />
Not everyone has heard of tapas, including some VCs as you’ll soon find out, so if you fall into this camp: Tapas are
much like Spanish appetizers, and you often make an entire meal out of them. They’re quite tasty, but the important part
for this story is how you say “tapas”: It’s a Spanish word, and a reasonable pronunciation is “taa puhz”. Back then, you
were more likely to find them in bigger cities or college towns, but they’ve become more popular in the modern era.</p>

<p>Now for the story: In the middle of the year 2000, Laura and I left Bell Labs for Silicon Valley. (Bell’s mother
company, Lucent, imploded over the following years, and I’ll let the reader decide if that’s correlation or causation.)
We became cofounders in a startup building high-speed networking gear, and since it was the absolute peak of the
internet bubble, it was a great time for raising capital. It was such a good time for raising capital that large throngs
of people started companies right alongside us, leading to a fight for basic resources such as suitable housing and
office space.</p>

<p>In order to avoid becoming homeless, we signed a year’s lease for an apartment sight unseen, which seemed expensive and
imprudent, but less expensive and imprudent than navigating the insanity in the housing market at the time. For the
problem of office space, the VCs helped by arranging for our company to sublease some temporary space from a software
company they had funded, which turned out to be an absolute cliché of an internet startup. They had two founders who
were the most senior of the tech team and looked like they might be about 25 years old. Moreover, a fair fraction of
their employees were young guys skipping college in order to become internet millionaires. Nevertheless, we were
grateful to have temporary office space, and the software team was certainly entertaining with a video game lounge and
Friday Nerf gun battles, but they were especially entertaining when they came back from their company outings.</p>

<p>Company outings can be a terrific way to build camaraderie among a team, but I don’t think I was quite prepared for what
it meant in that era. After pushing hard to meet a deadline, the software company would pack up and go to Las Vegas for
a weekend: These outings were budgeted in the business plan by their prudent CFO, who also told me he had a line item
for bail. Chatting with their guys after these weekends was even educational: It’s how I learned about the legality of
prostitution in Nevada as well as the existence of the Mustang Ranch.</p>

<p>However, this is not the salaciousness that I wanted to tell you about today.</p>

<p>The cofounder role is pretty broad, and part of that entailed meeting with the VCs, selling them on our technology,
taking their money, and then updating them on how the company was progressing. These updates happen in both a formal
setting, like board meetings, as well as informal settings, such as parties. It was only a few years since Laura and I
had finished grad school, and we kept our standard-of-living relatively modest, so the parties sometimes required
jumping into entirely different economic strata.</p>

<p>As an example, one of our VCs (who we will name “Jim”) threw a party at the end of summer. Jim was a newish VC and his
home might be best described as a starter mansion. He took some pride in the fact that he had earned money in college by
bartending, so he started off serving behind the bar, and he had a large vocabulary of boozy drinks. I didn’t refuse
Jim’s drinks (Why would I? That would be disrespectful) and there was a parade of people who we met at the bar. One of
those was a gentleman from another of our VC firms (let’s call him “Mike”) who approached us and introduced his
fiancée. It turns out the fiancée would become wife number 2 of 4 according to Wikipedia, but that had yet to be
revealed.</p>

<p>There was some perfunctory discussion about our new company, but then the conversation turned more social: We were all
commiserating about the difficult housing situation in Silicon Valley, that there was little to buy and the prices were
insane. Mike’s fiancée latched onto this topic and for a while it sounded like we were all talking about the same thing
until she said: “I mean, three million dollars will buy you a house, but it won’t be a 15,000 square feet mansion or
anything.” (She was from an area of Georgia where, apparently, such money would buy 15000 sq ft in the year 2000.)  This
conversation was something of an eye-opener. It was an even greater eye-opener when, several years later, we read about
Mike in the Wall Street Journal. The article included details involving an alleged paramour and alleged hush money and
alleged sex slaves. Not long after the WSJ article, he and the VC firm realized X-rated articles and lawsuits tend to be
large distractions, and so they parted ways.</p>

<p>However, this is not the salaciousness that I wanted to tell you about today.</p>

<p>Later that year around Christmas, there was another party where Jim and his wife (let’s name her “Alicia”) worked in
some probing questions about our company culture. Jim was always a little bit concerned about team development because
we had such a large percentage of PhDs, people from Bell Labs or equal caliber. Jim broached the topic by asking if we
had gone out as a group, and I thought the timing was fortuitous because the company had recently gathered in a trendy
San Francisco bar that serves tapas.</p>

<p>With that in mind, the conversation between Jim, Alicia, Laura and me went something like this:</p>

<p>Jim: “So tell us, what was the last outing that the company did as a group?”</p>

<p>JP: “Oh, our HR team organized a trip to a tapas bar up in San Francisco. I think we got almost everyone there, and it was a good time.”</p>

<p>Jim: “You said HR organized it?”</p>

<p>JP: “Yes that’s right, and the tapas bar people were great about getting everybody to mingle and interact.”</p>

<p>Alicia (looking at Laura): “And did you go too?”</p>

<p>Laura: “Of course. It was lots of fun.”</p>

<p>This had gone on for a while before Laura suddenly realized that Jim and Alicia were hearing “topless bar” every time we
said “tapas bar”. After a quick explanation of the main differences between the two types of bars, all of the polite
laughter and nervous laughter transformed into uproarious laughter.  We often wonder about the alternative timeline
where the confusion was not cleared up, and the conversation they might have had in their car ride home.</p>

<p>So that is the salaciousness I wanted to tell you about today: If you take $20 million from VCs and you’re hitting your
company goals, feel free to go to topless bars on the company dime. You can even have weekends of getting arrested in
Las Vegas provided that you’re building a solid esprit-du-corps. As long as you don’t make headlines in the Wall Street
Journal, you’ll barely raise anybody’s eyebrows.</p>

Chinese Beverage Torture, which always brings to mind another story from my teenage years: The first time I ever ate
Chinese food. My family’s food heritage comes with a large serving of pasta, and it took many years before I realized
that our Italian food heritage was probably stolen from China, most likely when Marco Polo came back from Asia and had a
terrible hankering for Peking Ravs.</p>

<p>Growing up, I was not the adventurous foodie you all know and love, and there was a pretty small set of things I would
eat. This state of affairs began in early childhood and continued through puberty, right up until I started dating
someone, who for the purpose of this story we will designate as The First Girlfriend, in order to protect the innocent.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/2023/wonton soup with a white chinese spoon.png" alt="image-left" class="align-left size-200px" />
When The First Girlfriend suggested that we go out with two other couples to a Chinese restaurant, that sounded like a
smashing idea, partly because it would ease the pressure of this whole dating thing and having to act as an entertaining
person. The only problem was that I had never had Chinese food. As a normal guy with the usual bucket of insecurities
that comes with being 16 years old, there was an acute social pressure to project being a Man of the World™, and there
was no way I could refuse the outing. At the heart of the matter however, I was mostly worried that I didn’t yet know
how to use chopsticks.</p>

<p>We all converged at the restaurant, and the six of us were seated at a round table with a lazy Susan to serve the food
family style.  We ordered wonton soup for an appetizer, and I was relieved because this would delay any use of
chopsticks. The soup arrived, and it was the first time I had encountered the oversized Chinese soup spoons, but this
was easy! The spoons were large! Everything was going swimmingly until it came time to eat the wonton.</p>

<p>The wonton seemed big, so naturally I decided to cut it in half. The spoon had an edge, but the treachery about to
unfold was that the edge of the spoon was rounded and smooth. Unfortunately, the bottom of the bowl was also rounded and
smooth.  Friends, do you know what happens when you try to cut an oversized wonton by forcefully pinching it between a
rounded and smooth spoon, and a rounded and smooth bowl?</p>

<p>The wonton shot out of the bowl and became an airborne projectile. It passed well above the lazy Susan, and over the
heads of our friends on the other side of the table. The rocket fuel that powers those damn things finally exhausted,
and it landed somewhere in the center of the restaurant.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, much laughter ensued. Our table was laughing. The other tables were laughing. The waiter pouring my
water at the time was laughing so hard he had to stop pouring the water.  But hilariously, <em>I</em> was
laughing. Predictably, I remember little else about the meal. I don’t think using chopsticks and my Man of the World™
projection played any role in the evening at all. In spite of such an incredible faux pas, The First Girlfriend and I
continued dating for some time after that, from which I conclude that the speed and distance at which I can catapult a
wonton demonstrates great strength and prowess, and is a terrific way to impress women.</p>

Mary Chung’s. The proprietor, Mary, helped to introduce Chinese food to many MIT students across several
generations. For those students who did not have a wide selection of cuisine before going to college, Mary’s was a
gateway drug to the wide world of food and gastronomy. Students would go there to celebrate achievements, or to drown
their sorrows, or most often just for tasty nourishment. As one of those students, I can tell you that Mary’s fortified
many of us sufficiently to face the rigors of MIT, or maybe it’s more truthful to say that she fattened us up
sufficiently to face the rigors of MIT. Most likely, it’s both.</p>

Sadly at the end of 2022, it came time for Mary to embark on a well-earned retirement and so she closed the
restaurant. Several of her fans started sharing tales about the restaurant across social media: The gatherings of
friends, the best dishes, and stories of their first visits. It reminded me of my own first visit, which I still
remember decades later.</p>

<p>In 1984, I was a sophomore with an undergraduate research project (UROP) in the MIT AI lab. The project I was working on
was a robot named TARDIS, which was an acronym for Tea And Ravioli Delivery Service. At some meeting, I said “that’s a
funny name”, revealing my lack of knowledge about both Dr Who and Mary Chung’s. Some kind grad student took pity on me
and dragged me to Mary’s to cure some of my ignorance.</p>

<p>When you sat down at the restaurant back then, the table was set with tea cups and a pitcher of water. The missing
teapot and missing water glasses would arrive at first service, but until then you were left no possibility of quenching
your thirst, because nobody would dare pour water into the tea cups unless you had the manners of someone raised by
wolves.</p>

<p>The grad student told me this part of the meal was called The Chinese Beverage Torture.</p>

<p>Naturally, since I was a sophomore with a sophomoric sense of humor, I proceeded to tell everyone I knew about this
Chinese restaurant which was great as long as you could endure The Chinese Beverage Torture. One person I told was a
high-school friend down the road at Harvard, who then proceeded speak at length about The Chinese Beverage Torture to
anyone in his dorm who would listen. The dead horse was beaten so often and so prolifically his dormmates told me they
had dubbed it The Chinese-Beverage-Torture Joke Torture.</p>

<p>So join me and raise your teacups and water glasses to Mary and her legacy of spreading joy and happiness and full
stomachs to the good people around Cambridge. I will remember Mary’s always for the Suan la Chow Show, the Peking Ravs,
the Dun Dun Noodles and especially for the Beverage Torture, the last of which was the start of many great
conversations.</p>
