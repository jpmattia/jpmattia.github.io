The earlier restaurant stories served as mere appetizers to an actual discussion of restaurants. Rather than describe
the spiraling path to how one begins spending inordinate amounts for great meals, or the self-rationalization and
self-justification for an obviously irrational habit, let's skip to the end of the story and discuss two of greatest
restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of [attending.]

Once you determine you're part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy

 Ding Dong/Ring Ding  "or as we prefer to call it"
 There are two ways: One is pomposity. Some people like that, but it's never been my style. The other is a celebration of
 food and eating, and I find that much more gratifying.
