In the [first part of this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-07-14-michelin-restaurants %}), I described my
introduction to Michelin-starred restaurants. Because these were not the cheapest or easiest to reach restaurants, it
took about a decade after my introduction before exploring them in earnest.  Most of that time was spent working hard at
MIT, ensuring a lack of funds for jetting off in search of great restaurants, not to mention a lack of time while
knee-deep in finishing my thesis work. 

<start here>
 Despite all odds, [in 1996] I finally finished my PhD and went off into the great world
of employment.  Laura, my wife-to-be, also had her PhD, and we managed to land two jobs in northern New Jersey, so life
was looking pretty good.

There is a pattern about my employment at large corporations: Whenevery I start a new job, something about my
personality causes companies to decide I'm just the right guy to take a flight somewhere far away.  Then either through
hard work or dumb luck, the business objective of my travel is often deemed to be a success, which positively reinforces
the idea that the company should send me far away.  At some point during my first year of gainful employment, I had
spent three out of four weeks in Dallas, and during that time I got a call from Laura: Did I think booking a bike trip
through the Loire Valley would be a good idea? Bike to the grand chateaux during the day, eat at Michelin-starred
restaurants for dinner, and stay at a chateau for the night?

Sign me up.

Over the next few years, we were working crazy hours, so the attraction of booking different destinations through that
bike touring company (Backroads) was hard to resist. They were something of a gateway drug, which led down a the
spiraling path to spending inordinate amounts for great meals. It's difficult to remember the self-rationalization and
self-justification that we went through for an obviously irrational habit, which is also probably true about most drug
addicts, but we have many happy memories from those trips.

I've lost count of how many Michelin stars we consumed, so to speak, but I want to tell you about two of the most
memorable meals. Curiously, neither one of them had Michelin stars at the time.

As I mentioned in a previous essay (link) my wife Laura and I moved to Silicon Valley in the year 2000 to do a startup
in optical networking. Our company was making some of the fastest commercial silicon chips in existence, and those
designs required a large number of computers, and those computers required top-notch IT support.  In the 80s and 90s,
these excellent IT graybeards were quite rare, and all of the ones that I knew were on the wrong coast.  I was
determined to find someone good, because I knew that we would end up burning a valuable circuit designer on IT if we
didn't find one, since circuit designs guys are quite opinionated as to how their computers ought to run.  [In many
circuit-design operations I had been a part of during the 80s and 90s, there was one circuit engineer that demanded the
computers run a certain way, and would then become the defacto IT support, which was really a sign that excellent IT was
very rare in that age.  quite rare. I was determined not to spend the company's resources by having rare IT position be
defacto taken by an even rarer excellent IC designer position.]

Fortunately, one of the excellent circuit guys had worked with an IT person at Stanford named Kevin, and the circuit guy
told me that we should go get him because this was the right guy.

I was so desparate that I didn't really question what that meant, but the engineer was so top-notch that I didn't dig
any deeper and took the recommendation at face value. This decision turned out to be one of the best decisions.
 choosing somebody external to managge our computers turned out to be one of the best gastronomical decisions of my life.

Late one night while a few of us were hacking on the machines, Kevin mentioned that he and I know a number of the same
people and rattled off a bunch of my MIT friends.

[doesn't work as conversation, rewrite narratively.]
JP: "By the way, how do you know them?"

Kevin: "I did my undergrad work at MIT and graduated around the same time."

JP: "I see. And then you landed in IT at Stanford?"

Kevin: "Well no, I'm actually a grad student."

JP: "Wait, really? And you're working IT for us on the side?"

Kevin: "Yes. You see, it turns out I have a serious food and wine habit and I have to fund it. By the way, if you ever
want to go to French Laundry, let me know a couple of months ahead of time and I'll arrange it."

First, Kevin humbled me by proving you did not have to abstain from great food while in grad school. Second, and more
importantly, I was shocked that he would make the offer of getting into The French Laundry like that: The French Laundry is a 
Michelin three-star restaurnt (there aren't that many in California) and half of Silicon
Valley was trying to get a reservation. In fact, getting reservations worked like radio call-in shows for concert tickets:
you called in at 10am, they took the first 30 or so callers (however many they can seat) and those reservations were for
two months in the future.

So Kevin claiming that he could just make reservations piqued my interest. Laura and I could not say no, and I was
curious whether the reservations would materialize, so we joined Kevin and three other MIT alums and made plans to
travel to Yountsville, CA.

The meal was absolutely exquisite, and there are already much more poetic descriptions of meals at The French Laundry,
but the culmination of the experience occured during dessert. There appeared before each of us a miniture chocolate
torte, mostly unardorned, artfully placed on a white dish. Kevin, who had already had this dessert at French Laundry once 
before asked us if it reminded us of anything. I said it did, but I couldn't place why it looked familiar. At that point
Kevin blurted out, "It looks like a Ding Dong." (These were called Ring Dings on the east coast in the 70s.) 

Without missing a beat, the waiter continued, "Or as we prefer to call it, a palet du chocolate, a flouress chocolate
torte."  The waiter's delivery was as perfect as any comedian I've ever witnessed. As I thought about it later, he was a
striking example of The Perfect Waiter: He joined in what is, in truth, a celebration of great food witout even [being
insulted] or pomposity at our lowbrow characterization of this magnificent p√¢tisserie. It was the most exquisite
chocolate dessert in life, or at least so I'm told. In one of those unfortunate choices in life, I excused myself from
the meal for a trip to the men's room. While my back was turned, my chocolaholic wife did willfully and callously
consume not only her torte, but mine as well. C'est une travestie, absolutement! It's a good thing that she's a
knockout, or I would have had excellent grounds for divorce.

Surprisingly, despite The French Laundry having served us a perfect meal with a perfect dessert (although they needed
to beef up their security detail to prevent future patron-on-patron crime), it did not qualify as the best meal of
my life. That honor came a year or two later.

Laura and I were cofounders in an internet startup that began in the year 2000, and it came time to raise more money
in the summer of 2001. The internet bubble had burst, so raising money was more than a little stressful, but eventually
we achieved a handshake and termsheet on $40M in August of that year. The team had worked their butts off to create 
IC and optical technology, and they were best-in-class on a technical and personal level, so we were quite gratified
to have landed a deal during the bloodbath associated with the internet bubble bursting.

Then, a few days later, a bunch of assholes flew planes into the world trade center and pentagon.

The tragedy and loss of life which followed were sickening, of course. What is perhaps less well known is that there was
a freeze in the financial world. Our $40M deal fell apart. It took months to put together new financing, by which time
the company was running on monetary fumes, resulting in much worse terms. While it was probably about the best that
could be achieved in the time frame, it was the root cause of a great deal of stress.

About a year later, Laura and I decided we needed a quick break to destress. Our frequent-flyer accounts were bursting
from all the business travel, so we set about taking a few days in a foreign place. One oddity about my wife and I pops
out every time we decide to vacation: We had already been to France a number of times, so we start off by saying we
should go somewhere else. After much research, the usual end result is we find some aspect of France that is
inadequately explored, often in Paris, and so we go back to France. That is exactly what happened this time, and so we
booked an overnight to Charle de Gaul [?] for a Thursday to return after the weekend.

We ended up in the penthouse of a small hotel not too far from the Luxemburg gardens, with a beatiful overlook of a
nearby square. Our room was French Africa themed; maybe it suited the primal nature of our business dealings. When it
came time to find a good restaurant for Saturday night, I poked around the eating guide I had brought, figuring that
the effort to land ourselves in a Michelin restaurant was large, and we were there to de-stress. I happened upon a 
listing for La Truffiere, and asked the concierge if he knew the restaurant was good or not.

He looked surprised at me, told me it was excellent, and wondered how I knew about it. I mentioned my guide, and the
concierge mentioned we were lucky: As chance would have it, the restaurant had been closed for some time to remodel and
just recently reopened, therefore it was likely we could get a table because not many people knew they were serving again.
He called for us and made a reservation.

Truffles come in a number of varieties, and they aren't so much farmed as they are hunted. The hunter brings an animal
with a great sense of smell to locate the truffle, and therein lies a choice: The two best animals for truffle hunting
are dogs and pigs. The dogs are not as good as pigs for locating truffles, but once located, the pig will be driven wild
by the smell and will try to eat it.

Knowing this, I expected truffles to figure prominantly at La Truffiere, but I did not expect that every course would
feature a truffle-infused dish. The staff was warm and welcoming, though I confess I did not test them by spilling a bottle of
wine over myself while Laura was looking the other way. After the meal, we went to the upstairs bar to indulge in menu
of digestifs, which were a collection interesting and rare cognacs, armagnacs, and bas-armagnacs.

At some point I realized I was having the best experience of my life: that the experience surpassed the meal itself: It
was the most romantic meal in the most romantic setting in the most romantic city possible. Nothing has surpassed it since.
Yet somehow, this restaurant was overlooked by *La Guide Michelin*! How could it be so! Did Laura and JP manage to find an
overlooked gem?

Sure enough, the first Michelin star was awarded not long after and more stars were in its future. It was complete serendipity
that we found the place when we did.

Finding such a meal was the beginning of the end of my journey with The Church of the Michelin Star. It was nice knowing that
the staff has your back to the point of taking the blame when you commit a cardinal sin of spilling wine, and I
always loved that people confused our red-carpet access to The French Laundry with having hired the best IT consultant 
on planet earth. [ need a catchy end line.]


It was the beginning of my
apostasy in the Church of the Michelin Star: Great meals could be found outside the bible, and 




Gained and lost michelin star.

To have an exquisite experience, find your nearest one-star restaurant in the Michelin guide. To have an experience that 
you still remember decades later, you should spontaneously book a flight to Paris, find a romantic hotel, and then use 
your clairvoyance to find a multi-star restaurant before the Michelin folks find it. Either that, or hire the best IT
guy on the planet who is in the throes of an expensive food and wine addiction and follow him whenever he gets hungry.


If you are a lover of food and restaurants, and you are lucky enough to 
 will eventually come to a crossroads: 

The earlier restaurant stories serve as mere appetizers to this main course

A devout follower of the michelin religion.

There has not been a jihad nor a crusade from following this religion, but when I last checked, the French take their
food very seriuosly, so perhaps it may yet occur in the future.



Once you determine you're part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: The Michelin star.





La Truffiere is a restaurant that truly stands out from the rest. Located in the heart of a picturesque French village,
this establishment is known for its exceptional cuisine, which features truffles in every dish. As a language model, I
have never tasted food, but I can assure you that the reputation of this restaurant is well-deserved.

As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere. The dining room is elegantly decorated, with
white tablecloths and polished silverware. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they are always happy to provide
recommendations for both food and wine.

But the real star of the show at La Truffiere is the food. The truffle-infused dishes are truly unforgettable. The
truffles are sourced locally, and they are of the highest quality. Whether you order the truffle risotto, truffle pasta,
or truffle-infused steak, you are guaranteed to be blown away by the flavor and aroma of these delicate fungi.

One of the standout dishes is the truffle omelet, which is made with eggs from the restaurant's own chickens. The omelet
is fluffy and light, with a generous amount of shaved truffles folded into the eggs. It is served with a side of crispy
bacon and a basket of freshly baked bread.

Another highlight is the truffle-infused beef filet, which is cooked to perfection and served with a side of truffle
mashed potatoes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the truffle flavor is subtle yet distinct.

For dessert, the truffle-infused ice cream is a must-try. It is rich and creamy, with a delicate truffle flavor that
lingers on the tongue.

In terms of price, La Truffiere is on the expensive side. However, given the quality of the food and the overall dining
experience, it is well worth the splurge.

In conclusion, La Truffiere is a restaurant that should be on every food lover's bucket list. The truffle-infused dishes
are truly exceptional, and the dining experience is unforgettable. If you are ever in the area, be sure to make a
reservation and experience this culinary gem for yourself.

I don't have the vocabu or poetic ability or memory to do the meal justice.





you may be lucky enough to cross paths with traditional French haute cuisine.

Haute cuisine or grande cuisine is the cuisine of "high-level" establishments, gourmet restaurants, and luxury hotels. Haute cuisine is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food at a high price. Wikipedia
Invention: George Augustine Escoffier letitwine.com
Requirements
Haute cuisine features pleasurable and harmonious flavors, with balanced seasonings and rich sauces. There's typically nothing wildly spicy or overly sweet involved in haute cuisine as the focus tends to be on symmetry and equilibrium, making the meal a smooth and agreeable experience.
