Laura and I were cofounders in an internet startup that began in the year 2000, and it came time to raise more money
in the summer of 2001. The internet bubble had burst, so raising money was more than a little stressful, but eventually
we achieved a handshake and termsheet on $40M in August of that year. The team had worked their butts off to create 
IC and optical technology, and they were best-in-class on a technical and personal level, so we were quite gratified
to have landed a deal during the bloodbath associated with the internet bubble bursting.

Then, a few days later, a bunch of assholes flew planes into the world trade center and pentagon.

The tragedy and loss of life which followed were sickening, opf course. What is perhaps less well known is that there was
a freeze in the financial world. Our $40M deal fell apart. It took months to put together new financing, by which time
the company was running on monetary fumes, resulting in much worse terms. While it was probably about the best that
could be achieved in the time frame, it was the root cause of a great deal of stress.

About a year later, Laura and I decided we needed a quick break to destress. Our frequent-flyer accounts were bursting
from all the business travel, so we set about taking a few days in a foreign place. One oddity about my wife and I pops
out every time we decide to vacation: We had already been to France a number of times, so we start off by saying we
should go somewhere else. After much research, the usual end result is we find some aspect of France that is
inadequately explored, often in Paris, and so we go back to France. That is exactly what happened this time, and so we
booked an overnight to Charle de Gaul [?] for a Thursday to return after the weekend.

We ended up in the penthouse of a small hotel not too far from the Luxemburg gardens, with a beatiful overlook of a
nearby square. Our room was French Africa themed; maybe it suited the primal nature of our business dealings. When it
came time to find a good restaurant for Saturday night, I poked around the eating guide I had brought, figuring that
the effort to land ourselves in a Michelin restaurant was large, and we were there to de-stress. I happened upon a 
listing for La Truffiere, and asked the concierge if he knew the restaurant was good or not.

He looked surprised at me, told me it was excellent, and wondered how I knew about it. I mentioned my guide, and the
concierge mentioned we were lucky: As chance would have it, the restaurant had been closed for some time to remodel and
just recently reopened, therefore it was likely we could get a table because not many people knew they were serving again.
He called for us and made a reservation.

Truffles come in a number of varieties, and they aren't so much farmed as they are hunted. The hunter brings an animal
with a great sense of smell to locate the truffle, and therein lies a choice: The two best animals for truffle hunting
are dogs and pigs. The dogs are not as good as pigs for locating truffles, but once located, the pig will be driven wild
by the smell and will try to eat it.

Knowing this, I expected truffles to figure prominantly at La Truffiere, but I did not expect that every course would
feature a truffle-infused dish. The staff was warm and welcoming, though I confess I did not test them by spilling a bottle of
wine over myself while Laura was looking the other way. After the meal, we went to the upstairs bar to indulge in menu
of digestifs, which were a collection interesting and rare cognacs, armagnacs, and bas-armagnacs.

At some point I realized I was having the best experience of my life: that the experience surpassed the meal itself: It
was the most romantic meal in the most romantic setting in the most romantic city possible. Nothing has surpassed it since.
Yet somehow, this restaurant was overlooked by *La Guide Michelin*! How could it be so! Did Laura and JP manage to find an
overlooked gem?

Sure enough, the first Michelin star was awarded not long after and more stars were in its future. It was complete serendipity
that we found the place when we did.

Finding such a meal was the beginning of the end of my journey with The Church of the Michelin Star. It was nice knowing that
the staff has your back to the point of taking the blame when you commit a cardinal sin of spilling wine, and I
always loved that people confused our red-carpet access to The French Laundry with having hired the best IT consultant 
on planet earth. [ need a catchy end line.]


It was the beginning of my
apostasy in the Church of the Michelin Star: Great meals could be found outside the bible, and 




Gained and lost michelin star.

To have an exquisite experience, find your nearest one-star restaurant in the Michelin guide. To have an experience that 
you still remember decades later, you should spontaneously book a flight to Paris, find a romantic hotel, and then use 
your clairvoyance to find a multi-star restaurant before the Michelin folks find it. Either that, or hire the best IT
guy on the planet who is in the throes of an expensive food and wine addiction and follow him whenever he gets hungry.


If you are a lover of food and restaurants, and you are lucky enough to 
 will eventually come to a crossroads: 

The earlier restaurant stories serve as mere appetizers to this main course

A devout follower of the michelin religion.

There has not been a jihad nor a crusade from following this religion, but when I last checked, the French take their
food very seriuosly, so perhaps it may yet occur in the future.



Once you determine you're part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: The Michelin star.









La Truffiere is a restaurant that truly stands out from the rest. Located in the heart of a picturesque French village,
this establishment is known for its exceptional cuisine, which features truffles in every dish. As a language model, I
have never tasted food, but I can assure you that the reputation of this restaurant is well-deserved.

As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere. The dining room is elegantly decorated, with
white tablecloths and polished silverware. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they are always happy to provide
recommendations for both food and wine.

But the real star of the show at La Truffiere is the food. The truffle-infused dishes are truly unforgettable. The
truffles are sourced locally, and they are of the highest quality. Whether you order the truffle risotto, truffle pasta,
or truffle-infused steak, you are guaranteed to be blown away by the flavor and aroma of these delicate fungi.

One of the standout dishes is the truffle omelet, which is made with eggs from the restaurant's own chickens. The omelet
is fluffy and light, with a generous amount of shaved truffles folded into the eggs. It is served with a side of crispy
bacon and a basket of freshly baked bread.

Another highlight is the truffle-infused beef filet, which is cooked to perfection and served with a side of truffle
mashed potatoes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the truffle flavor is subtle yet distinct.

For dessert, the truffle-infused ice cream is a must-try. It is rich and creamy, with a delicate truffle flavor that
lingers on the tongue.

In terms of price, La Truffiere is on the expensive side. However, given the quality of the food and the overall dining
experience, it is well worth the splurge.

In conclusion, La Truffiere is a restaurant that should be on every food lover's bucket list. The truffle-infused dishes
are truly exceptional, and the dining experience is unforgettable. If you are ever in the area, be sure to make a
reservation and experience this culinary gem for yourself.

I don't have the vocabu or poetic ability or memory to do the meal justice.





you may be lucky enough to cross paths with traditional French haute cuisine.

Haute cuisine or grande cuisine is the cuisine of "high-level" establishments, gourmet restaurants, and luxury hotels. Haute cuisine is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food at a high price. Wikipedia
Invention: George Augustine Escoffier letitwine.com
Requirements
Haute cuisine features pleasurable and harmonious flavors, with balanced seasonings and rich sauces. There's typically nothing wildly spicy or overly sweet involved in haute cuisine as the focus tends to be on symmetry and equilibrium, making the meal a smooth and agreeable experience.
