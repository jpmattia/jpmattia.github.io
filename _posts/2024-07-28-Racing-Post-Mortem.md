In a quest to maintain fitness, I signed up for "Run For The Ranch 2024", a series of three 5K races at Paramount
Ranch. Paramount Ranch is now part of the National Park Service, but at one time served as the backlot for Paramount
Films and had semi-permanent facades for filming scenes in the old west. Sadly in 2018, most of the buildings burned
down in the Woosley fire. The races are a way to raise money for replacing the buildings with updated fire-proof
construction. Since the wife and I hike there almost daily, I signed up for all three races.

I wanted to collect my race results in one place for future reference, and I also got a bunch of questions from friends
about the race details, so I'll give you the bottom line first: There was a reason the US Olympic committee didn't
bother sending me to the Paris olympics this week. I've never been a particularly fast runner. While staying active is a
pretty big priority for me to increase longevity[^1], I almost never look too critically at my running times, so after the
races I wanted to look in some detail at what my results were.

Here are the results by the numbers

| Race date    | minutes/mile | Rank in age group |
| -------- | ------- |
| July 11, 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  8:38   | 3rd |
| July 18, 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  8:31   | 2nd |
| July 25, 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |  8:40   | 3rd |


The runner who placed first on the July 11 and 25 races failed to show up for the July 18 race, which is why I placed
second. So I think the moral of the story is: If I want to win races, I need to focus harder on eliminating the
competitation before they appear at the starting line.

I'll also note that temperatures were in the mid-to-high 80s for all three races. Running in 80 degree temps sounds
terrible until you think about the people running the Badwater 135 ultramarathon, which occurred earlier a few days ago.
The typical starting temperature is 115 degrees, proving the running adage: No matter how bad it seems, somebody else
always has it worse.

Here are a few other items I wanted to collect in one place.
 - The two 60 yo faster than me were in the 7:30 min/mile range.
 - There is a 100 ft hill right in the middle of the race, which practically killed me. Hill profile in the pics below.
 - Apple fitness stats:
   - VO2Max: 51.3 
   - Max HR: 166
   - Resting HR: 43
   - HR variability: 43ms


Lastly, some pics to help me remember the pain: {% include gallery id="race_pics" layout=half %}

[^1]: I'm not so interested in adding years to the end of my life, so much as I'm interested in adding years in the middle.
