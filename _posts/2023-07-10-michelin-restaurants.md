If you are a food lover, then you have almost certainly sampled different cuisines from a wide swath of restaurants, and
probably you have memories of a few favorite meals.  Perhaps you are so enthusiastic that your friends started refering
to you as a "foodie", either complimentarily or pejoratively. Maybe you went so far as to rank order your favorite
restaurants, and since anything worth doing is worth overdoing, you found yourself asking the question: What is the best
restaurant in the world?

It turns out I have all of the above traits with a double dose of anything-worth-doing-is-worth-overdoing, so this is
the first of two posts on how I went about answering the question. Naturally, everyone has different tastes and that
will lead them to different paths with different answers. My path led me to the Church of the Michelin Star.

As mentioned [elsewhere]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-04-21-the-curious-wonton %}), it took me until high school
before learning there is more to good food than my family's Italian-centric cuisine. Going to college and grad school in
the Boston area guarenteed a broadening of horizons, and I was fortunate to have friends from a wide distribution of
backgrounds organizing trips to many different types of restaurants.  Unfortunately, choosing a eaterie while in school
usually comes with financial limitations; the best restaurants tended to be the most expensive, so those were saved for
special occasions.

Sorting through restaurants to find the best ones was not easy in the pre-internet world, and broadly, there were two
approaches. The first was to eat at as many restaurants as possible. This approach was a lot of fun, especially with the
metabolism of a twenty-year old who burns an insane number of calories on classes or martial arts or pretty much
anything that a twenty-year old does.  Unfortunately, a quick calculation involving the number of restaurants in
existence and the size of the average student's wallet shows the impracticality of exploring anything more than a small
fraction of Bostonian eateries.  The second approach was to descend upon the campus bookstore in search of restaurant
guides, and compile a list of the best restaurants. It's probably obvious that no guides were ever actually purchased
since we were impoverished students saving money for the actual meal.

The first few of the restaurants on that list felt like a discovery of new lands, and they were a feast for the
senses. It was an awakening of tastes, aromas, and textures. It turns out that I was lucky to start as a young guy;
students of biology will tell you that the olfactory and taste senses peak in the twenties. Of course, the experience
was more than just great food: The restaurant staff play a large role, almost as a performance. I belived had found the
pinnacle of civilization and was fortunate that my choice of college put me so close to it.

Then a funny thing happened during my senior year. A girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Europe during MIT's
January term. She had a colorful uncle who we met in Geneva, who we will name Henry for this story. Henry had finished
grad school in the US in the early 70s, went off to Europe, and never really returned. As near as I could tell, he just
stayed to become a bon vivant, spending a lot of time studying good food and wine and, well, life. I got along
inexplicably well with this full-fledged adult, despite feeling like a kid on his first European tour.  Henry was an
excellent host to a couple of college students, and he decided to take our eductation into his own hands: He told us
with some gravity that he was going to bring us to a Michelin one-star restaurant.

The voice inside my head had a reaction: One star? So what? I did not know what a Michelin one-star restaurant implied
when I walked in, but it turned out to be the nicest dining experience I had ever had at that point. I was, frankly,
stunned; it was a revelation that people would dedicate their lives to creating the world's greatest meals, and could
transform food into such a high art form.

It was also something of a revelation that the campus bookstore did not have the most worldly collection of books
outside of academic subjects.  Most folks have heard of the Michelin Tire Company, which is one of the oldest tire
corporations and is based in France, but it was pretty much the last company that I would have sought out for advice
about restaurants during college.  Michelin was first published its eponymous guide in 1926, and it has an interesting
history with restaurants.  Early on in automobile history, many companies published travel guides as marketing to
encourage automobile travel, and Michelin took the approach of including reviews of hotels and restaurants: The more
mileage that is put on the tires, the more tires they sell.

Eventually the Michelin marketing took on a life of its own. The best restaurant reviews were also awarded "Michelin
Stars", and their graphical star is shown here. Frankly, when you consider gluttony is still one of the seven deadly
sins, a pentagram would have been more apt, but for reasons known only to a tire company, a rounded six-point star is
their mark of approval. In any case, unlike modern internet ratings, not all restaurants are given a star rating; only
those who "consistently deliver an outstanding meal" are awarded even a single star. The largest number ever awarded are
three stars, and if you are a foodie those places are worthy of a special pilgrimage. At the time of my first visit to a
one-star, there were 574 restaurants with one star, 84 with two-stars, and 20 with three-stars.  The ratings were
carried out by a 16 person Michelin panel, who we can safely assume have never been given accolades by doctors for their
cholestoral readings. As an aside, it's also worth noting that Geneva was included in the French guide, which was
something of a poke in the eye to the Swiss: Geneva has a history of going back and forth between French and Swiss
ownership, and could be perceived as Michelin replanting a French flag on the beach of Lake Geneva.

At the end of the meal with Henry, I had many questions. I asked the one foremost in my mind: If that was a one star
experience, what on earth happens in a three star restaurant that doesn't happen in a one star?  Henry smiled, and then
he delivered a critique of the best meal of my life up to that point. There was some extreme nit picking on the harmony
of flavors, and there was some other nit picking about second course (there were many courses) that was presented with a
temperature a little low. You could say it was because we talked too much and the food got cold, or you could say it was
because the plates were not sufficiently warm for a January meal.

He also waxed poetic on the proper amount of attention from the restaurant staff: It should be extremely attentive while
simultaneously being completely unobtrusive. As near as I can tell, the wait staff were hired partially for their
empathy and clairvoyance, and during that era, being a waiter in a Michelin-starred restaurant had a social cache in
Europe that was hard to understand in American culture.

In order to provide an example of great service, Henry related his ultimate three-star restaurant story.
He was trying to impress a woman and took her to a Michelin three star. In the middle of an amazing meal,
while the woman
was momentarily looking away, Henry accidentally knocked over a bottle of wine, spilling it on the
table and himself. Before the woman even looked up, a waiter appeared out of nowhere and began 
apologizing profusely for
having so clumsily spilled the wine. *Quelle catastrophe!* The waiter didn't know how such a thing could have
happened! Henry graciously told him it was ok and that accidents happen. The waiter then insisted on at least paying for
the cleaning of Henry's clothes; Henry thanked the waiter for the offer and assured him that would not be
necessary. I have no doubt that Henry left an additional *service* [ie tip] that is still being talked about.

By the time I left Europe, I realized there was something of a religous zealotry about Michelin restaurants,


That was my first attendance in The Church of the Michelin Star, and I would have happily made pilgramages to collect
other stars, but alas I was a student. Worse still, I would continue living the student life for about a decade as I
took a very scenic route through grad school. It was nearly a decade before I started earning an honest paycheck, one
that was sufficient for burning money on such outings.



Then during a business trip, I got a call from my wife Laura: Did I think booking a bike trip through the Loire Valley
would be a good idea? Bike through the grand chateaux during the day, eat at Michelin-starred restaurants for dinner,
and stay at a chateau for the night? Ah, it seemed that my wife was baptized in this religion, and it was the first
batch of many great pilgrimages to the holy shrines of the Michelin church.

Rather than describe the spiraling path to how one begins spending inordinate amounts for great meals, or the
self-rationalization and self-justification for an obviously irrational habit, let's skip to the end of the story and
discuss two of greatest restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of [attending. eating at]

As I mentioned in a previous essay (link) my wife Laura and I moved to Silicon Valley in the year 2000 to do a startup
in optical networking. Our company was making some of the fastest commercial silicon chips
in existence, and those designs required a large number of computers, and those computers required top-notch IT support.
In the 80s and 90s, these excellent IT graybeards were quite rare, and all of the ones that I knew were on the wrong coast.
I was determined to find someone good, because I knew that we would end up burning a valuable circuit designer on IT if 
we didn't find one, since circuit designs guys are quite opinionated as to how their computers ought to run.
[In many circuit-design operations I had been a part of during
the 80s and 90s, there was one circuit engineer that demanded the computers run a certain way, and would then become 
the defacto IT support, which was really a sign that excellent IT was very rare in that age.
quite rare. I was determined not to spend the company's resources by having rare IT position be defacto taken by 
an even rarer excellent IC designer position.]

Fortunately, one of the excellent circuit guys had worked with an IT person at Stanford named Kevin, and the circuit guy
told me that we should go get him because this was the right guy.

I was so desparate that I didn't really question what that meant, but the engineer was so top-notch that I didn't dig
any deeper and took the recommendation at face value. This decision turned out to be one of the best decisions.
 choosing somebody external to managge our computers turned out to be one of the best gastronomical decisions of my life.

Late one night while a few of us were hacking on the machines, Kevin mentioned that he and I know a number of the same
people and rattled off a bunch of my MIT friends.

[doesn't work as conversation, rewrite narratively.]
JP: "By the way, how do you know them?"

Kevin: "I did my undergrad work at MIT and graduated around the same time."

JP: "I see. And then you landed in IT at Stanford?"

Kevin: "Well no, I'm actually a grad student."

JP: "Wait, really? And you're working IT for us on the side?"

Kevin: "Yes. You see, it turns out I have a serious food and wine habit and I have to fund it. By the way, if you ever
want to go to French Laundry, let me know a couple of months ahead of time and I'll arrange it."

First, Kevin humbled me by proving you did not have to abstain from great food while in grad school. Second, and more
importantly, I was shocked that he would make the offer of getting into The French Laundry like that: The French Laundry is a 
Michelin three-star restaurnt (there aren't that many in California) and half of Silicon
Valley was trying to get a reservation. In fact, getting reservations worked like radio call-in shows for concert tickets:
you called in at 10am, they took the first 30 or so callers (however many they can seat) and those reservations were for
two months in the future.

So Kevin claiming that he could just make reservations piqued my interest. Laura and I could not say no, and I was
curious whether the reservations would materialize, so we joined Kevin and three other MIT alums and made plans to
travel to Yountsville, CA.

The meal was absolutely exquisite, and there are already much more poetic descriptions of meals at The French Laundry,
but the culmination of the experience occured during dessert. There appeared before each of us a miniture chocolate
torte, mostly unardorned, artfully placed on a white dish. Kevin, who had already had this dessert at French Laundry once 
before asked us if it reminded us of anything. I said it did, but I couldn't place why it looked familiar. At that point
Kevin blurted out, "It looks like a Ding Dong." (These were called Ring Dings on the east coast in the 70s.) 

Without missing a beat, the waiter continued, "Or as we prefer to call it, a palet du chocolate, a flouress chocolate
torte."  The waiter's delivery was as perfect as any comedian I've ever witnessed. As I thought about it later, he was a
striking example of The Perfect Waiter: He joined in what is, in truth, a celebration of great food witout even [being
insulted] or pomposity at our lowbrow characterization of this magnificent pâtisserie. It was the most exquisite
chocolate dessert in life, or at least so I'm told. In one of those unfortunate choices in life, I excused myself from
the meal for a trip to the men's room. While my back was turned, my chocolaholic wife did willfully and callously
consume not only her torte, but mine as well. C'est une travestie, absolutement! It's a good thing that she's a
knockout, or I would have had excellent grounds for divorce.

Surprisingly, despite The French Laundry having served us a perfect meal with a perfect dessert (although they needed
to beef up their security detail to prevent future patron-on-patron crime), it did not qualify as the best meal of
my life. That honor came a year or two later.

Laura and I were cofounders in an internet startup that began in the year 2000, and it came time to raise more money
in the summer of 2001. The internet bubble had burst, so raising money was more than a little stressful, but eventually
we achieved a handshake and termsheet on $40M in August of that year. The team had worked their butts off to create 
IC and optical technology, and they were best-in-class on a technical and personal level, so we were quite gratified
to have landed a deal during the bloodbath associated with the internet bubble bursting.

Then, a few days later, a bunch of assholes flew planes into the world trade center and pentagon.

The tragedy and loss of life which followed were sickening, of course. What is perhaps less well known is that there was
a freeze in the financial world. Our $40M deal fell apart. It took months to put together new financing, by which time
the company was running on monetary fumes, resulting in much worse terms. While it was probably about the best that
could be achieved in the time frame, it was the root cause of a great deal of stress.

About a year later, Laura and I decided we needed a quick break to destress. Our frequent-flyer accounts were bursting
from all the business travel, so we set about taking a few days in a foreign place. One oddity about my wife and I pops
out every time we decide to vacation: We had already been to France a number of times, so we start off by saying we
should go somewhere else. After much research, the usual end result is we find some aspect of France that is
inadequately explored, often in Paris, and so we go back to France. That is exactly what happened this time, and so we
booked an overnight to Charle de Gaul [?] for a Thursday to return after the weekend.

We ended up in the penthouse of a small hotel not too far from the Luxemburg gardens, with a beatiful overlook of a
nearby square. Our room was French Africa themed; maybe it suited the primal nature of our business dealings. When it
came time to find a good restaurant for Saturday night, I poked around the eating guide I had brought, figuring that
the effort to land ourselves in a Michelin restaurant was large, and we were there to de-stress. I happened upon a 
listing for La Truffiere, and asked the concierge if he knew the restaurant was good or not.

He looked surprised at me, told me it was excellent, and wondered how I knew about it. I mentioned my guide, and the
concierge mentioned we were lucky: As chance would have it, the restaurant had been closed for some time to remodel and
just recently reopened, therefore it was likely we could get a table because not many people knew they were serving again.
He called for us and made a reservation.

Truffles come in a number of varieties, and they aren't so much farmed as they are hunted. The hunter brings an animal
with a great sense of smell to locate the truffle, and therein lies a choice: The two best animals for truffle hunting
are dogs and pigs. The dogs are not as good as pigs for locating truffles, but once located, the pig will be driven wild
by the smell and will try to eat it.

Knowing this, I expected truffles to figure prominantly at La Truffiere, but I did not expect that every course would
feature a truffle-infused dish. The staff was warm and welcoming, though I confess I did not test them by spilling a bottle of
wine over myself while Laura was looking the other way. After the meal, we went to the upstairs bar to indulge in menu
of digestifs, which were a collection interesting and rare cognacs, armagnacs, and bas-armagnacs.

At some point I realized I was having the best experience of my life: that the experience surpassed the meal itself: It
was the most romantic meal in the most romantic setting in the most romantic city possible. Nothing has surpassed it since.
Yet somehow, this restaurant was overlooked by *La Guide Michelin*! How could it be so! Did Laura and JP manage to find an
overlooked gem?

Sure enough, the first Michelin star was awarded not long after and more stars were in its future. It was complete serendipity
that we found the place when we did.

Finding such a meal was the beginning of the end of my journey with The Church of the Michelin Star. It was nice knowing that
the staff has your back to the point of taking the blame when you commit a cardinal sin of spilling wine, and I
always loved that people confused our red-carpet access to The French Laundry with having hired the best IT consultant 
on planet earth. [ need a catchy end line.]


It was the beginning of my
apostasy in the Church of the Michelin Star: Great meals could be found outside the bible, and 




Gained and lost michelin star.

To have an exquisite experience, find your nearest one-star restaurant in the Michelin guide. To have an experience that 
you still remember decades later, you should spontaneously book a flight to Paris, find a romantic hotel, and then use 
your clairvoyance to find a multi-star restaurant before the Michelin folks find it. Either that, or hire the best IT
guy on the planet who is in the throes of an expensive food and wine addiction and follow him whenever he gets hungry.


If you are a lover of food and restaurants, and you are lucky enough to 
 will eventually come to a crossroads: 

The earlier restaurant stories serve as mere appetizers to this main course

A devout follower of the michelin religion.

There has not been a jihad nor a crusade from following this religion, but when I last checked, the French take their
food very seriuosly, so perhaps it may yet occur in the future.



Once you determine you're part of the food-curious part of humanity, how does one go about finding the greatest
restaurants on earth? Obviously this is a completely subjective choice with many different philosophies. Being a lazy
person, I was presented with a shortcut and I took it: The Michelin star.





La Truffiere is a restaurant that truly stands out from the rest. Located in the heart of a picturesque French village,
this establishment is known for its exceptional cuisine, which features truffles in every dish. As a language model, I
have never tasted food, but I can assure you that the reputation of this restaurant is well-deserved.

As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by a warm and inviting atmosphere. The dining room is elegantly decorated, with
white tablecloths and polished silverware. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and they are always happy to provide
recommendations for both food and wine.

But the real star of the show at La Truffiere is the food. The truffle-infused dishes are truly unforgettable. The
truffles are sourced locally, and they are of the highest quality. Whether you order the truffle risotto, truffle pasta,
or truffle-infused steak, you are guaranteed to be blown away by the flavor and aroma of these delicate fungi.

One of the standout dishes is the truffle omelet, which is made with eggs from the restaurant's own chickens. The omelet
is fluffy and light, with a generous amount of shaved truffles folded into the eggs. It is served with a side of crispy
bacon and a basket of freshly baked bread.

Another highlight is the truffle-infused beef filet, which is cooked to perfection and served with a side of truffle
mashed potatoes. The meat is tender and juicy, and the truffle flavor is subtle yet distinct.

For dessert, the truffle-infused ice cream is a must-try. It is rich and creamy, with a delicate truffle flavor that
lingers on the tongue.

In terms of price, La Truffiere is on the expensive side. However, given the quality of the food and the overall dining
experience, it is well worth the splurge.

In conclusion, La Truffiere is a restaurant that should be on every food lover's bucket list. The truffle-infused dishes
are truly exceptional, and the dining experience is unforgettable. If you are ever in the area, be sure to make a
reservation and experience this culinary gem for yourself.

I don't have the vocabu or poetic ability or memory to do the meal justice.





you may be lucky enough to cross paths with traditional French haute cuisine.

Haute cuisine or grande cuisine is the cuisine of "high-level" establishments, gourmet restaurants, and luxury hotels. Haute cuisine is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food at a high price. Wikipedia
Invention: George Augustine Escoffier letitwine.com
Requirements
Haute cuisine features pleasurable and harmonious flavors, with balanced seasonings and rich sauces. There's typically nothing wildly spicy or overly sweet involved in haute cuisine as the focus tends to be on symmetry and equilibrium, making the meal a smooth and agreeable experience.
