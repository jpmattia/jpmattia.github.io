### About Me

Welcome! If we've not already met, I'm JP Mattia. I started this blog mainly out of peer pressure, which really means
that after writing some posts about restaurants, a couple of comments said "You should write some essays or a
memoir". I'm 100% sure everyone who said that now regrets it.

The brief outline of my life: I grew up in southern Connecticut, left to attend MIT in 1982, and didn't leave
until 1996.  While that's not a career path that would suit everybody, it was exactly the right life for me. Along the
way, I worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for some years, and collected a small pile of degrees. I also collected a wife,
Laura, who collected her own pile of MIT degrees.

After some years in commercial R&D (Texas Instruments and Bell Labs), Laura and I set out for the land of startups in
Silicon Valley. These days, we run a [video delivery business](https://www.centaurdelivery.com) for advertisers, which
puts content into 6000+ TV, cable, and digital outlets.

Much of my free time is spent outdoors hiking and generally being healthy, with the hope that I can undo some of the
crazy behavior from my youth.

I hope you enjoy the tales herein.

### About the blog

Originally, I was mostly dismissive of setting up a blog. As I kept looking at the various options in the current
market, I kept getting drawn in. "Oh, I can use ruby? Cool!" "Oh, github will host it? Cool!" Eventually, I broke down
and set up this software over the course of a few evenings.

This software is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and runs under [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
The Jekyll theme is mostly [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme), but there
are a bunch of customizations. If you are dying to see those customizations, all is revealed in my [Github
repo](https://github.com/jpmattia/jpmattia.github.io), although you are warned that there are some quick and dirty hacks
to get things looking like I want.
